_By Frank "Weekie" Podraza_

I've spent the past 2 years developing prototypes of first-person games. The current prototype is under the moniker of "Castle Wars". It is based on the Halo Reach gamemode of the same name. Castle Wars is a simple networked multiplayer game where two teams fight to control the other's castles. It will be published on Steam, and is primarily a PC game (though if it finds success, expansion to other platforms is on the table).

I am running a (somewhat out of date) blog on its development at [**the Nerd Herd Network website**](https://www.nerdherd.network/castle-wars/){:target="_blank"}.

### Notable features
- Extensive first-person character controller with many unique movement abilities
- Local and networked split-screen
- Steam integration and online multiplayer
- Lobbies for collecting players, setting up the game, and assigning teams
- Auto-generating settings menus 
- Client-side predictive, server authenticated movement to prevent cheating
