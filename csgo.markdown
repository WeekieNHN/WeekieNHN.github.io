_By Frank "Weekie" Podraza_

The program was originally a small phone project for a few friends to play in the park. Then I wanted to make the program run on a standalone device. I took raspberry Pi with Windows IOT and wrote the project in unity. It was slow, but it worked. It could only be controlled from a separate laptop.

I wanted it to be faster. I also wanted to learn Python. Since I could easily get python running on the Raspberry Pi, I built the game in that. It took a few days, and a lot of spagetti code, but it works. There is a Bomb Defuse mode like Counter-Strike, as well as king of the Hill from Halo, and Secure Area from Rainbow Six: Siege. It plays sounds from the various games.

Other improvements include:

- A settings menu to edit timings
- The ability to set the code for bomb defuse
- A settings menu to edit timings
- A lot of changes to how bomb defuse works
  - Defusing the bomb takes time
  - Typing the wrong code locks the player out for some time
  - A delete button for when you make a mistake typing in the code

There are quite a few videos on the Nerd Herd Network Channel of us playing with this prop in different setups.
