# Physical Programming

Physical Programming is what we are using as a catch-all term for projects that are more than just software. These projects have some physical component too.

## CSGO Prop

The CSGO Prop is a raspberry pi based box which acts as a prop C4 from the game CSGO. Built entirely in python using the pygame library, the CSGO Prop allows the user to play CSGO in real life with nerf guns. It has multiple game modes. There is a CSGO game mode, of course, but also King of the Hill from Halo, or Call of Duty, as well as secure area from Rainbow 6 Siege.
