# Intro/Ideation

A while back I watched a [Miziziziz Video](https://youtu.be/5-iST0a69cI?si=3U4mzQ9sm-osOv-Z&t=189) which suggested the idea of making an arena shooter where bullets don't do damage, but instead knock enemies back. I was in the throws of debugging some network troubles I was having with [Castle Wars](/projects/castle-wars/) so I decided to give it a stab.

I'd make 1 map, 1 player controller, and let up to 4 players play split-screen in an arena shooter. Likewise, to prevent some scoping issues. I instituted what I called a "rule of 4" meaning that anything I add there can only be 4 of. Examples include
- 4 weapons
- 4 grenades
- 4 traps
- 4 enemy types
- 4 inventory slots

This was all to keep myself from going crazy, and also to keep the amount of work manageable. 

# Weapons

The first bit of work I did consisted of getting the player character working, split screen set up, and building out a basic interation and inventory system. I then built a shop from which players can buy items. The first set of items I wanted to build were weapons. I'm an FPS kid at heart, so I really like making shooters.

I added a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, and rocket launcher (blame my Halo roots for this). I got models from Kenney Assets and I animated pickup and fire animations for each one.

I don't think that words are going to do any of it justice, so I suggest you watch this video:
