Castle Wars had accrued enough technical debt worthy of a restart, so I'm doing it, and I'm doing it right this time. I started with basic networking and split screen since those were the straws that broke the camel's back with the previous prototype. I also set up device management, and an input handler to allow us to build in split-screen support later down the line. 

Blog posts are going to be shorter these days, but the frequency of uploads is going to go up, so hopefully that's a worthy trade.

Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy the video!
