I needed some mechanics to populate maps with, to expand our movement sandbox, and to spice up the game. This week I added Planets you can walk on, Man Cannons, Anti-Gravity rooms, Ladders, Teleporters, and Moving Platforms. This video is documentation of my progress.

Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy the video!
