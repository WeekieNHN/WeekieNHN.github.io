I built advanced movement abilities into my FPS Character controller since I want my player character to be as customizable as possible. I built in dashing, sliding, swimming, and flying alongside the usual suite of walking, sprinting, jumping, and crouching. All of this is network-ready which will help us in the future.

I'm not sure if all of these abilities will make it into the release (given how far out that is), but I'd rather turn them off than not have them in the first place.

Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy the video!
