We can't have a first-person game without health or interaction systems. This week, we're building everything that comes with a health system (health kits, kill planes, regeneration, fall damage, respawn cycle) and the interaction system (pickups, health kits, and ladders). We're also going to round out our Game Settings and our Pause Menu to finish off this set of work on the game.

I hope y'all enjoy the video!
