I've been getting some ideas for maps which I really want to try out. The first idea, and what I added this week, is a capture-the-flag map where players will spawn on the poles of a planet, and walk around that planet to defeat the other team. It's a little trippy.

Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy the video!
